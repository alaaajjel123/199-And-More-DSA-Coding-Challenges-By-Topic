# Problem: Longest Strictly Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
nums = [300,9,2,5,3,7,500,400]

**Output:**  
4

**Explanation:**  
The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,500], therefore the length is 4.
