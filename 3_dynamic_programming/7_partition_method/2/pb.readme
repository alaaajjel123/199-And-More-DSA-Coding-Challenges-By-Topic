# Problem: Minimum Cuts for Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.  
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

## Example:

**Input:**  
s = "ppq"

**Output:**  
1

**Explanation:**  
The palindrome partitioning ["pp","q"] could be produced using 1 cut.
