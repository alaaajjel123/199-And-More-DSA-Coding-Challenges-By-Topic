# Problem: Palindromic Substrings

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
s = "pqrp"

**Output:**  
4

**Explanation:**  
Three palindromic strings: "p", "q", "r", "p".
