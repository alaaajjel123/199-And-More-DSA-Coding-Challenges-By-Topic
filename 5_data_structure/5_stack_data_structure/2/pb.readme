# Problem: Evaluate the Value of an Arithmetic Expression in Reverse Polish Notation

Valid operators are +, -, *, and /.

Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero. It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

### Input:
The input is an array of strings where each element is either a valid operator or an integer.

### Example:
