# Problem: Container with Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). 

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water (depth is constant across containers). 

Return the area (that the 2 lines and the x-axis make) of the container which can store the maximum amount of water. 

Notice that you may not slant the container.
