# Problem: Design a Binary Search Tree

Design a Binary Search Tree class that supports the following operations:

### Methods:

1. **Insert a value** - Insert a new value into the Binary Search Tree.

2. **Remove a value** - This method should remove the first occurrence of the specified value from the tree.

3. **Find a value** - If the value is found in the tree, it should return the node with that value. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

### Notes:
- The Binary Search Tree follows the standard property that all left child nodes are less than the parent node, and all right child nodes are greater than the parent node.
