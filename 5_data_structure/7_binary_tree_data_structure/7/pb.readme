# Problem: Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

### Task:

You are given an array where the elements are strictly in increasing (ascending) order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree. A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node does not differ by more than 1.
