# Problem: Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal of Graph

### Task:

You are given an undirected graph stored:

1. As an **adjacency list**
2. As an **adjacency matrix**

Write functions to traverse this graph using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach. 

### Requirements:

- As you traverse the graph, store the values of the vertices in an array.
- Return this array after completing the BFS traversal.

### Notes:

- The BFS traversal starts from a given node and explores all its neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- Ensure to handle both the adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations of the graph.
