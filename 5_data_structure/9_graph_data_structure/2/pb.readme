# Problem: Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal of Graph

### Task:

You are given a graph stored as an **adjacency list**. Write functions to traverse the graph using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach.

### Requirements:

1) Implement **DFS recursively**.
2) Implement **DFS iteratively**.

As you traverse the graph, store the values of the vertices in an array and return this array after completing the DFS traversal.

### Notes:

- The DFS traversal starts from a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Ensure to handle both recursive and iterative implementations of DFS.
