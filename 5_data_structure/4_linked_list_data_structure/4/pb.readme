# Problem: Cycle Detection

You are given the head of a linked list. Check if there is a cycle and if yes, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Do not modify the linked list.
