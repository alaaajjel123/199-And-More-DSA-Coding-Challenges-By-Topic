# Problem: Priority Queue as a Min Binary Heap

### Task:

Implement a **Priority Queue** as a **min Binary Heap**. The **Priority Queue** class should support the following functions:

1. **Enqueue**: 
   - Insert an element into the priority queue.

2. **Dequeue**: 
   - Extract the element with the highest priority (lowest numerical priority is treated as highest priority).

### Notes:

- The priority queue will be implemented using a min binary heap.
- A min binary heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.
- The root of the heap will hold the smallest element, which corresponds to the highest priority.
