# Problem: Binary Search

### Task:

Given an array of integers which is sorted in ascending order, and a target integer, write a function to search for whether the target integer is present in the given array. If it is present, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

### Requirements:

- You must write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.
- The input array is sorted in ascending order.
