# Problem: Merge Sort

### Task:

You are given an array of integers. Write a function that will take this array as input and return the sorted array using Merge sort.

### Example:

- Input: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`
- Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`

### Note:

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together in a sorted manner.
